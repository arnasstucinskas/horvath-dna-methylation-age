# Exploration of first DNA methylation age model by Steve Horvath

In this project, I pursued a self-directed learning initiative on the study entitled “DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types” which was written by Steve Horvath. My main goal was to learn more about the model structure. To accomplish this, I used the supplementary materials in the paper and also incorporated the code within it into my R programming style. This adaptation process is not just a coding practice but an analytical way to gain insight into the many nuances of the DNA methylation age model.
